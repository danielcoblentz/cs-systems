# Homework 0 â€” Programming Language Genealogy

points: 20 points

Objective:
Explore the history and evolution of programming languages by creating a genealogy chart (timeline) that shows how at least five programming languages are related to each other over time. Develop an understanding of each language's origins, unique traits, and role in computer science.

Instructions:
1. Choose at least 5 programming languages that are historically or technically connected (e.g., C -> C++ -> Java -> C# -> Rust).
2. Create a visual genealogy (timeline or family tree diagram) that clearly shows:
	- The year each language was created.
	- How languages influenced or descended from one another.
3. For each language, include two distinctive features such as:
	- Why it was created (e.g., to improve portability, memory safety, or developer productivity).
	- A unique language feature (e.g., garbage collection, first-class functions, pattern matching).
	- An interesting fact (e.g., developed by a particular company, used in a famous project, or inspired a major technology shift).
4. Format: You may create your genealogy using presentation software (PowerPoint, Google Slides), diagramming tools (Lucidchart, Draw.io), or by hand (scan or photograph neatly).
5. Use AI tools, reference books, or reputable websites for research only as a helper--not as a way to produce the complete assignment. If you use AI, refer to the GenAI policy from our syllabus.
6. Deliverables:
	- A single-page diagram showing your timeline/genealogy.
	- A short description (3-5 sentences) explaining how you chose your languages and what connections you noticed.
7. Evaluation Criteria:
	- Accuracy of timeline and relationships (30%)
	- Quality and clarity of visual presentation (25%)
	- Completeness of distinctive features (25%)
	- Effort, creativity, and clarity of written explanation (20%)
8. Presentation: Two students will be randomly selected to present their homework.

Good luck!
