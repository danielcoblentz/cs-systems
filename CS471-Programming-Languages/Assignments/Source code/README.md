# Source code examples (Scheme / Guile)

This folder contains Scheme/Guile example programs used in class. Several files were originally stored with a `.txt` extension; they have been renamed to `.scm` to reflect their language and to make them executable with Guile.

How to run (macOS / Linux):

1. Make the script executable: chmod +x <file>.scm
2. Run directly: ./<file>.scm <args>
   or: guile <file>.scm <args>

Files:
- `hello.scm` — simple Hello World example.
- `fact.scm`, `fact_main.scm` — factorial function and a main wrapper.
- `foo.scm` — tiny example function.
- `hypotenuse.scm` — computes hypotenuse length.
