# CS471 — Programming Languages

This folder contains course materials for CS471 (Programming Languages). The layout below groups lecture slides, assignments, in-class exercises, and resources so you can quickly find readings, examples, and code.

Top-level contents
------------------
- `Lecture Slides/` — slide decks and lecture notes (organized by chapter when available).
- `Assignments/` — homework assignments, lab exercises, and example source code.
- `In class Assignments/` — short in-class exercises and notes.
- `resources/` — reference PDFs, code examples (Lex/Yacc), and additional links.

Week-by-week outline (suggested mapping)
---------------------------------------
Below is a suggested week-by-week mapping. Update dates as needed.

Week 1 — Introduction, Syntax vs Semantics
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/` (look for intro/overview PDFs)
- Read: `resources/anatomy.pdf`

Week 2 — Lexical analysis & Parsing
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/Chapter 3/` (parsing/grammars)
- Examples: `Assignments/Lexer and Parer/` (see `lex_bookcode.c`, `parser_bookcode.c`) and `resources/LexAndYaccCode/` (sample .l and .y files)

Week 3 — Type Systems and Data Abstraction
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/` (search for type-related PDFs)
- Read: selected papers in `resources/extra_links.txt`

Week 4 — Functional Programming
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/Functional Programming, Part I.pdf` and `Functional Programming Languages, Part 2.pdf`
- Examples: `Assignments/Source code/` contains Scheme/Guile examples (hello.scm, fact.scm).

Week 5 — Object-Oriented Paradigms
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/OO Paradigm Summary.pdf`

Week 6 — Language implementation and runtime
- Slides: `Lecture Slides/Programming Language Descriptions and Implementations.pdf`
- Tools & Examples: `resources/LexAndYaccCode/`

Week 7 — Advanced topics (monads, type inference, concurrency)
- Slides and papers: check `resources/` and `extra_links.txt` for recommended readings.

Navigation tips
---------------
- To run Scheme/Guile examples: see `Assignments/Source code/README.md` (scripts are `.scm`).
- Lex/Yacc examples live in `resources/LexAndYaccCode/` (l/y files). The `calc*.l` and `calc*.y` provide small calculators you can rebuild with flex/bison or lex/yacc.

Contributing
------------
- Add slide decks to `Lecture Slides/`.
- Place homework/solutions in `Assignments/` and include a `README.md` per assignment describing submission and grading notes.

If you'd like, I can:
- Normalize file names (prefix slide files or assignment folders with numbers).
- Create per-week README files inside `Lecture Slides/` and `Assignments/` if you want deeper structure.
