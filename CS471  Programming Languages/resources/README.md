Resources for CS471 (Programming Languages)

This directory contains reference materials, tutorials, and example code used in the course.

Key items
- `LexAndYaccCode/` — example lex/yacc files and generated artifacts for small calculators.
- `LexAndYaccTutorial.pdf` — tutorial slides or notes on lex/yacc.
- `anatomy.pdf`, `cool_manual.pdf` — additional reading materials.
- `extra_links.txt` — curated links and seminal papers.

If you need files renamed or moved into subfolders by topic (parsing, type systems, functional programming), tell me which grouping you prefer and I can reorganize them.
