Linking to content
------------------

Use the links above to jump to the relevant folder. If a slide or homework file is missing, consider adding it with the recommended naming format:
- Slides: `NN-topic.pdf` (e.g. `01-intro.pdf`)
- Homework folders: `Homework - N/` with an internal `README.md` describing the assignment and submission instructions.

. gitignore
-----------

A `.gitignore` is included to ignore temporary files, OS artifacts, and editor files. If you use other tools (e.g., IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse), add their patterns as needed.

Contributing
------------

- Add slides to `Lecture Slides/`.
- Add homework to the appropriate `Homework - N/` folder and include a `README.md` with instructions.
- Keep solutions in a separate `solutions/` folder if you want to share them with staff only.

If you'd like, I can:
- Rename files for consistent naming (e.g., prefix slides with numbers).
- Move any stray homework files into `Homework/`.
- Create `Homework/Homework - N/README.md` templates for each assignment.

If you want me to perform any moves/renames (for example moving the syllabus into `References/` or deleting the old `lecture slides/` folder after confirming files are copied), tell me which changes and I'll apply them.
