# Operating Systems (Course Materials)

This folder holds course materials for an Operating Systems course. The structure below is intended to keep slides, assignments, exams, and references organized.

Quick index (existing items detected in this folder):

- `assignments/` — assignment and lab subfolders (may contain per-assignment directories).
- `Exams/` — midterms, finals, practice exams and solutions.
- `leture slides/` — lecture slide decks (note: folder name has a typo; see "Notes" below).
- `refrences/` — reference materials and reading lists (note: folder name has a typo; see "Notes").
- `OS quizes.pdf` — a PDF found in the root of this folder (likely quizzes compilation).
- `Process (Code).docx` — a document with code or process notes.
- `syllabus_464_25s(1).docx` — course syllabus document.

Suggested folder structure
--------------------------

Keep this top-level layout for clarity:

- `Lecture Slides/` — slide decks, one file per lecture with leading numbers: `01-intro.pdf`, `02-processes.pdf`.
- `Assignments/` — create per-assignment folders: `Assignment-01/`, `Assignment-02/` containing problem statements, starter code, and datasets.
- `Exams/` — organized by semester or year: `2025-Fall/`, `2024-Spring/`.
- `References/` — papers, book excerpts, and external links used in class.

Naming conventions
------------------

- Use lowercase or Title-Case consistently and avoid spaces when possible. Use hyphens for readability: `assignment-01.pdf` or `Assignment-01/`.
- Prefix lecture slides and assignments with a two-digit index to preserve order: `01-`, `02-`, etc.
- Include the year or semester on big artifacts (exams, syllabus) when relevant: `final-2025.pdf`, `syllabus-464-fall-2025.docx`.

Notes & housekeeping
--------------------

- There are a couple of likely typos in folder names: `leture slides/` should be `Lecture Slides/` and `refrences/` should be `References/`. Consider renaming those folders to keep the structure consistent.
- Small files found in the root (e.g., `OS quizes.pdf`, `Process (Code).docx`, `syllabus_464_25s(1).docx`) should be moved into the appropriate subfolders (`Exams/`, `Assignments/` or `References/`) and renamed to follow the conventions above.
- If you want, I can rename those folders and move those files into suggested locations; tell me which renames/moves to perform.

How to contribute
-----------------

- Add new lecture slides to `Lecture Slides/` and follow the naming convention. If slides contain instructor-only solutions, mark them with `-solutions` in the filename and consider adding access rules (if this repo will be shared).
- For assignments, create a folder `Assignment-##/` and include `README.md` with submission instructions and grading rubric. Keep student submissions in a separate location (not in this repo) if they contain private data.
- If you add code, include a `LICENSE` or header indicating allowed reuse.

Contact / maintainer
--------------------

Include instructor or maintainer contact info here (email or GitHub username) so contributors know who to ask about content or permissions.

Last notes
----------

If you'd like, I can:

- Rename `leture slides/` -> `Lecture Slides/` and `refrences/` -> `References/`.
- Move `OS quizes.pdf` into `Exams/` and `Process (Code).docx` into `Assignments/` or `Lecture Slides/` depending on your preference.
- Create template files for assignments, exams, and lecture slide naming.

Tell me which of these you'd like me to do next and I will proceed.
