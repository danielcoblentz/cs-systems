Homework 1: Data
==============================
****** Submit a soft copy to the Blackboard. ****** 
****** You may work in a group of 2 ******
****** Points: 44

1. (12 points) For each attribute given, classify its type as:
- discrete or continuous AND
- qualitative or quantitative AND
- nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio
Indicate your reasoning if you think there may be some ambiguity in some cases.

Example: Age in years.
Answer: Discrete, quantitative, ratio.

(a) Favorite movie title of each student in CS 422/522.
Answer: 
(b) Number of (whole) days since Aug. 19, 2024.
Answer: 
(c) Category of a hurricane (The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ranges from category 1 to category 5).
Answer: 
(d) GPA of a student, beteen 0.0-4.0.
Answer: 

2. (12 points) For the following vectors, x and y, calculate the indicated similarity or distance measures. Show your work for full credits.

x = (0, 1, 0, 1), y = (1, 0, 1, 0) ==>cosine, correlation, Euclidean, Jaccard

3. (10 points) State the type of each attribute (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) given below before and after we have performed the following transformation.
(a) Hair color of a person is mapped to the following values: black = 0, brown = 1, red = 2, blonde = 3, grey = 4, white = 5.
Answer: 
(b) Age of a person is discretized to the following scale: Age < 12, 12= Age < 21, 21 = Age < 45, 45 = Age < 65, Age > 65.
Answer: 
(c) Height of a person is changed from meters to feet.
Answer: 
(d) Height of a person is changed from meters to {Short, Medium, Tall}.
Answer: 
(e) Weight of a person is standardized by subtracting it with the mean of the weight for all people and dividing by its standard deviation.
Answer: 

4. (10 points) Null values in data records may refer to missing or inapplicable values. Consider the following table of employees for a hypothetical organization:

Name 	Sales 	commission Occupation
================================
John 	5000 	Sales
Mary 	1000 	Sales
Bob 	null 	Non-sales
Lisa 	null 	Non-sales

The null values in the table refer to inapplicable values since sales commissions are calculated for sales employees only. Suppose we are interested
to calculate the similarity between users based on their sales commission.
(a) Explain what is the limitation of the approach to compute similarity if we replace the null values in sales commission by 0.
(b) Explain what is the limitation of the approach to compute similarity if we replace the null values in sales commission with the average value of sales commission (i.e., 3000).
(c) Propose a method that can handle null values in the sales commission so that employees who have the same occupation are closer to each other than to employees who have different occupations. Removing rows is not acceptable here.
