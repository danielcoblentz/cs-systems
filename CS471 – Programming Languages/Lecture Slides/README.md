# Lecture Slides — CS471

This directory uses numbered, descriptive filenames to make week-by-week navigation easy. Use the links below to open the slide decks (the numbered filenames are the canonical copies):

- `01-chapter-3-parsing.pdf`
- `02-chapter-4.pdf`
- `03-functional-programming-part-1.pdf`
- `04-functional-programming-part-2.pdf`
- `05-oo-paradigm-summary.pdf`
- `06-programming-language-descriptions-and-implementations.pdf`
- `07-python-oo-programming.pdf`
- `08-chapter-11.pdf`

If you'd like me to physically remove the older duplicate files (they appear in the folder but weren't removed due to an encoding/path issue), I can attempt deletion again or we can leave them as-is — the numbered files are the canonical copies.
